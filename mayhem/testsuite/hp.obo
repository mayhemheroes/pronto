def: "Short distance from the end of the finger to the most distal interphalangeal crease or the distal interphalangeal joint flexion point. That is, hypoplasia of one or more of the distal phalanx of finger." [HPO:probinson, PMID:19125433]
comment: This term differs from Partial absence of the finger because in that term, the phalanx must be missing, whereas in this term it may be small, but present. Distal phalangeal lengths can be assessed subjectively by comparing that digit segment to the rest of the digit, to other normal digits in that patient, or to typical patients of that age or build. Regarding the subjective definition, for individuals who do not have flexion creases, one may determine this by flexing the DIP joint and estimating the length of the terminal segment of the digit. Alternatively, one may be able to palpate the joint.
